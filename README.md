# Arduino Scout Robot

A scout robot project based on the Arduino platform, designed for movement and environment exploration.

## Description

The robot uses DC motors and a phone's lidar sensor (iPhone 12 Pro) to detect obstacles. With simple algorithms, it can live-stream images in the interface, automatically turn on the phone flashlight when it's too dark, and warn about objects using the lidar sensor.
